***Highlights***

•	Midlife constitutes a pivotal period characterized by a discontinuity in brain structure.

•	Early middle-aged adults (age 45-55) adopt a "semantic strategy" to facilitate semantic access and sustain lexical production (LP) performances.

•	Late middle-aged adults (age 55-60) gradually lose the ability to exert cognitive control over semantic representations, marking the onset of LP decline.
